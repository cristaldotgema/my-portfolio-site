                <p>
                    At the moment, I provide commissions services for illustration/visual arts and soon for web design projects, with different
                    prices for level of complexity. Whether it’s book covers, banner images, icons, presentation images,
                    or character depictions; it’s all on the table as an option. Getting accurate prices as of now would
                    require getting a
                    <a href="/contact.html">quote</a>. More illustration examples can be seen in my
                    <a href="/portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.

                    <button class="accordion-opener" type="button">

                        <p>
                            Depending on the level of complexity, the price scale varies hugely. The lowest cost for a formal commission would be $25
                            for really simple services without discounts, but for more complex commissions, it can easily
                            reach much more. You'd have to
                            <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> telling me what you have in mind and then get a quote.

                        <p>
                            Anywhere from finishing in the same day to taking a couple weeks, the time is entirely dependent on the level of complexity
                            of the commission and any possible complications there might be. Everything and anything would
                            be communicated during the commissioning process so you would be aware of it all as a customer.

                            I accept payment through paypal, which accepts credit/debit cards and paypal fund transfers. Half of the payment is received
                            at the start of the commission process as payment for my service after confirming that the potential
                            client wants to go through with the process and I agree with the kind of service/product the
                            client wants if I believe I can do it. The other half is payed at the end as payment for the
                            finished product.

                            In most cases, like the client deciding they don't need the product after it was already made or my service already started,
                            no. Only in the following circumstances would I refund: A) Overestimated my schedule or circumstance
                            and can't finish or start the commission, there'd be a full refund and partial refund respectively.
                            B) The client realizes they don't want to commission anymore before there is work put into the
                            commission.

                            Magz delivers so well and goes the extra mile, I commissioned him for a header and he did amazing on it, his art style is
                            incredible and I always reccomend him for commissions mainly cause he knows what he's doing and
                            he's trustworthy. We were complete strangers when I commissioned too, so I just took a chance
                            and he really did Alla Dat for me.

                            When I purchased a commission from you, it was actually one of the first times I had ever done so. I was really hesitant
                            since I didnt know how the process worked, and wasn't sure how my character would look since
                            I had never seen them drawn before! When I was sent the progress pics, I was amazed. Seriously.
                            All I had was a small list dictating what my OC looked like, and somehow they were there - just
                            as I imagined. I later used that 'sketch' as a reference for future commissions! :)

                                Illustration Prize will be:
                                <br /> 1 (one) illustration piece that can be in the format of (an provided as) 1)a banner image
                                2)an icon 3)the original full-piece. Dimensions and DPI as large as 4000 by 4000 pixels with
                                350dpi. Illustration can have as much as a decently detailed foreground, background, and
                                (up to) 3 central characters (excluding possible implied background characters). Check Portfolio
                                Page for a good idea of what can be allowed as an illustration. Subjects that won’t be accepted
                                for moral reasons are that of pedophilia, incest, racism, xenophobia, sexism, transphobia,
                                homophobia, islamophobia, anti-semitism, genocide, rape, etc. In the sense of supporting
                                or normalizing such causes. I would suggest to not request subjects such as complex machinery
                                or mecha, 3 point perspective, or anything of the sort as it would not be an effective use
                                of the Free Art Giveaway as I do not yet specialize in these depictions enough. The illustration
                                will have a limit of 2 revamping states, or reworking the illustration heavily after suggestion,
                                for the sake of time and practicality.

                                What will be given in the giveaway to the winner is a license to use the illustration for their own purposes as long as it
                                isn’t for vile, inappropriate, or discriminatory purposes. I will still have been the creator
                                and legal owner of the illustration, but will give a license to use it to the winner as “Licensed
                                Content” without need of additional purchase to use it, thus “free” for the winner’s use
                                and to republish in it’s original form, and ability to edit it with prior permission of me,
